	<p>The UMP Faculty of Computer Systems & Software Engineering was established on 16 February
	   2002 to produce knowledgeable, high skilled and competitive graduates within the sphere of 
	   software engineering, system and computer network. At the beginning, the faculty had two 
	   fields which are Software Engineering and Networking.
	</p>
	
	
	<p>The faculty has also embarked on research and development activities in the area such as 
	information systems, software engineering, computer systems, communication systems, graphic 
	and multimedia technology to produce technologies that are relevant to the needs of industries.
	Currently, the faculty has four research groups which are Network & Security, Modeling & Simulation,
	Data Mining & Knowledge Management and Graphic & Image Processing to support university’s focus 
	groups (Manufacturing & Automotive and Chemical & Biotechnology).
	</p>
	
	<p>The faculty emphasizes on the development and growth of its students’ enrolment and graduates. 
	Through high quality teaching (by completing specific quality outcome and generic skills), great 
	laboratories facilities, proper and careful advising and numerous professional activities, our 
	students have opportunity to excel in the classroom and laboratory session. In a personable atmosphere,
	the students become well prepared in the term of software engineering knowledge and technical skills. 
	Thus, they are ready and confident to begin their professional career or further their studies.
	</p>
	
	<p>The faculty’s current planning is to be an ICT reference centre in Pahang to support the development 
	of East Coast Economic Region (ECER), Malaysia. To realize this, many activities which involve industries
	and government sectors have been carried out.
